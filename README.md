# UpLiftU - A MENTAL HEALTH AND SELF-CARE APPLICATION

**Abstract:** UpLiftU is a holistic app that blends mental well-being and productivity. It aids users in building resilience, stress management, and healthy habits cost-effectively. The app tracks mood, sleep, and relevant factors for proactive self-care. Beyond a traditional mobile app, UpLiftU aspires to be a comprehensive platform with personalized tools, including habit monitoring, expressive writing, art therapy, music, meditation, mood tracking, fitness content, and journaling, addressing diverse facets of mental wellness.

**Methodology:**
1. **Planning:** We started by carefully planning the project, discussing ideas, and creating basic designs to guide us. We set clear goals, assigned tasks to team members, and created a timeline to follow.

2. **Understanding Users:** We looked at other mental health apps to understand what users might need. We talked to people to find out what features they wanted and what problems they faced with existing apps.

3. **Design:** Based on what we learned, we created an easy-to-use design for the app. We used a programming language called Flutter Dart and a tool called Visual Studio to build it. We kept referring back to our initial designs to make sure everything looked right.

4. **Development:** This is where we actually wrote the code for the app. We used Flutter Dart in Visual Studio and we worked together to make sure the code was good quality and did what it was supposed to do.

5. **Testing:** Before releasing the app, we tested it thoroughly to make sure it worked well. We checked for bugs and tried out different scenarios to make sure it was easy to use.

6. **Deployment:** Once we were happy with the app, we released it to the public. We had a plan for how to launch it, and we kept an eye on how things were going to make sure everything went smoothly.

Users have told us that using the app has helped them feel less stressed, happier, and more productive. They particularly like features like habit tracking, writing, art therapy, music, meditation, mood tracking, fitness content, and journaling. The profile page, which shows data like habit tracking and mood graphs, has been especially useful for users to track their progress and understand how their mental health is changing over time. Overall, the feedback has been positive, and we're glad that the app is helping people improve their emotional well-being in an easy and friendly way.
